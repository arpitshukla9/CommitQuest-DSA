## Problem Details

### 1. Step Words Finder  
**What:** Given a base word and a list of words, count how many can be formed by adding one letter and rearranging  
**How:** Frequency map comparison with one extra character  
**Time:** O(N Ã— K), **Space:** O(1)

### 2. Smallest Non-Representable Sum  
**What:** Find the smallest sum that cannot be formed using any subset of given coins  
**How:** Greedily accumulate sums, break when coin > current sum + 1  
**Time:** O(n), **Space:** O(1)

### 3. LCS of Three Strings  
**What:** Find the length of the longest common subsequence among three strings  
**How:** Use 3D DP table: dp[i][j][k] = LCS till i,j,k  
**Time:** O(nÂ³), **Space:** O(nÂ³)
